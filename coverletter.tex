My name is Aman Nijjar and I am a 4th year computer engineering student from the University of Victoria, located in Victoria, BC Canada. I wish to start a co-op with your company this upcoming September. A little about myself: I enjoy hiking around the local lakes of my home, trying different foods, and helping out at my uncles auto shop. My peers describe me as spontaneous, confident, and motivated because of my ability to execute activities with little to no planning time. My best experiences have been a 24-hour local expedition eating foods in different parts of Vancouver BC, an early morning picnic at Cadboro Bay, and after-hours basketball sessions with the old team-mates. \linebreak \\

That said, I believe my skills and experience match closely to the listed responsibilities and requirements: I have prepared schedules and maintained records from my time as the president of a robotics club, I have met and comfortably engaged with representatives from technical companies such as Rainhouse Canada, Huawei Canada, and Ocean Networks Canada to discuss sponsorships, donations, and planning events, and have taken classes on electrical power systems and drive systems. Moreover, I have knowledge of 2D/3D drafting from SolidWorks and I also have a valid class 5 driver's licence. \linebreak \\

In regards to technical ability, I am familiar with electrical systems and control communications. At my current co-op, I am designing a CAN bus communication system for an autonomous underwater vehicle. CAN is a communication standard that allows devices to communicate with one another without a host computer arbitrating who has priority on the bus. This decentralized design is popular with vehicles, but with the large list of standards available, it is reasonable to say it can be integrated to an existing gas system. \linebreak \\

Thank you for taking the time to read my application. If my background, skills, and experience is in line with what {\company} looks for in their co-op students, please feel free to contact me at anijjar@uvic.ca. \linebreak \linebreak 

All the best, \linebreak \linebreak \\

Aman Nijjar.
