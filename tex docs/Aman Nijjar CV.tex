%\end{itemize}

% \cvsubsection{Software Development}
% \begin{itemize}
%     \item Wrote C firmware on a FreeRTOS device to program a temperature \\sensor and a humidity sensor over I2C.
%     \item Implemented CAN communication between nodes on an AUV. This \\design decentralized the system, allowing messages to be broadcast to all nodes, instead of point-to-point connection with USB.
%     \item Used multiple programming languages (C/C++/Python) to link ROS noetic on Ubuntu Focal with the AUV embedded system at AUVIC to channel messages over a CAN bus.

\cvsection{Personal Projects}
\cvsubsection{Haze Removal - C++ Image Processing}
This command line application removes fog and haze in images by using dark channel prior and several other filters. Created from Rachel Yuen's (UW-Madison) matlab script. The Robot Operating System lacks Matlab support, so I rewrote the script in C++ to test it on AUVIC's AUV.

\cvsubsection{Audio-Effects PCB - C Signal Processing}
An embedded application for the STM32F0xx discovery board. This board takes an audio signal and then filters it with a butterworth filter before entering the ADC on the STM. The STM then applies either an echo or pitching effect to the signal via buttons  before being sent out of the DAC to be played through a speaker for everyone to enjoy.

%\cvsubsection{Street Traffic Simulator - C Real-Time Operating \\Systems}
%Simulates a one way street with a traffic light at different rates of traffic via LEDs. Uses 4 RTOS tasks and communicates with one another using queues. Rate of traffic is adjusted using a \\potentiometer.
%\divider
%\cvsubsection{Aircraft Weight Shifter -  Electrical Drive Systems}
%Presented a weight shifting solution for an aircraft using requirements my professor was given. Its purpose was to adjust an aircrafts centre of gravity to reduce its pitching moment.

% \cvsubsection{Coup online - HTML/CSS/Javascript}
% Building a web game based on the "Coup" by Rikki Tahta to play with my friends while in quarantine. This game is not released to the public.
